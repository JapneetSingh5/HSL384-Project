Heartaches By The Number,Guy Mitchell,"Heartaches by the Number Lyrics[Chorus]
Heartaches by the number, troubles by the score

And heartache number two was when you came back again

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

Mack The Knife,Bobby Darin,"Mack the Knife LyricsOh the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it outta sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life, eek
And someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?
There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a-drooping on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, ho ho, Suky Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

I said, Jenny Diver, woah, Suky Tawdry
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya and ol' Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

Mr. Blue,The Fleetwoods,"Mr. Blue Lyrics[Intro]
Our guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue
Like him, I am doubtful that your love is true
But if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue

Then prove it by goin' out on the sly
Provin' your love isn't true

When you say you're sorry (I'm Mr. Blue)
Then turn around, headin' for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through

I stay at home at night (I stay at home)
Right by the phone at night (Right by the phone)
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mister

While you paint the town (I'm Mr. Blue)
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm paintin' it, too
But I'm paintin' it blue

Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,The Platters,"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes LyricsThey asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Stagger Lee,Lloyd Price,"Stagger Lee LyricsThe night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men who were gambling in the dark
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy, ""I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new Stetson hat.""
(Go, Stagger Lee.)
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four
Said, ""I'm going to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe.""
(Go, Stagger Lee.) Go on, Stagger Lee!
(Oooh, wah.) Look out there now!
(Oooh, wah.) Come on, Stag, stop playing!
Oooh, wah, oooh, wah, oooh
Ahhh

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
Said, ""Now nobody move."" and he pulled out his forty-four
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.)  ""Stagger Lee,"" cried Billy
""Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children and a very sickly wife.""
(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass
Look out, Stag, go!  (Go, Stagger Lee.)

(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Yeah, do move that!

The Battle Of New Orleans,Johnny Horton,"The Battle of New Orleans Lyrics[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town near New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[Verse 2]
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood beside our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise

If we didn't fire our muskets

The Three Bells,The Browns,"The Three Bells (Les Trois Cloches) LyricsThere's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees, half forlorn
And there, on a sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the song that they were singing
Was for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love.""
There's a village, hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing
'Twas a great day in his life
Cause the song that they were singing
Was for Jimmy and his wife

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
""Lead us not into temptation
Bless, O Lord, this celebration
May their lives be filled with love.""

From the village, hidden deep in the valley
One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to Heaven
Jimmy Brown had passed away
Just one lonely bell was ringing
In the little valley town
'Twas farewell that it was singing
To our dear old Jimmy Brown
